# gcodepylot
A python package to manually control 3D printers or other gcode-based hardware. Useful if you are hacking a 3dp to do something else!

This codebase is written to interface with [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org). We tested this code specifically with SKR Mini E3 V1.2-2.0 boards, both attached to Ender 3's and custom gantrys.
